# Component | Card

Card is an opinionated container component that can be used to group other components. By default, it wraps its children in a card-like UI.

<Tabs groupId="sdkLanguage">
    <TabItem value="node" label="TypeScript / JavaScript">
    ```js
    ui.card([
        ui.header("Users", { size: "sm" }),
        ui.text("10 users found in database.")
    ])
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    ui.card([
        ui.header("Users", size="sm"),
        ui.text("10 users found in database.")
    ])
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Internally, `ui.card` is a convenience wrapper around `ui.stack` with default properties set accordingly. This means that all the properties available to `ui.stack` are also available to `ui.card`.

## API reference

See the [Stack API reference](/components/layout/stack#api-reference) for more details. The only difference is that `ui.card` applies some default styles to the stack.
