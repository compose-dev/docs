# Component | Row

Row is a generic container component that can be used to group other components. By default, it arranges its children in a horizontal row.

Internally, `ui.row` is a `div` and rendered as a flexbox container. It's primary use is for controlling the layout of its children and applying other styles to control the look of your app.

`ui.row` is a convenience wrapper around `ui.stack` that sets the `direction` property to `"horizontal"`. This means that all the properties available to `ui.stack` are also available to `ui.row`.

## API reference

See the [Stack API reference](/components/layout/stack#api-reference) for more details. The only difference is that `ui.row` sets the `direction` property to `"horizontal"` by default.
