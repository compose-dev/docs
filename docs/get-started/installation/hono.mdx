# Installation | Hono

Compose is not yet supported for Hono.

The Compose SDK requires a long-running server process to maintain a websocket connection to the Compose web dashboard. This is not compatible with Hono, which is designed for a new server process to spin up for each request (i.e. serverless).

We recommend deploying a dedicated Node.js project for your Compose apps. Many existing users already do exactly this.

Read the guide for creating a new project for Compose [here](/get-started/installation/new-project/node-js).
