# Installation | Python

<Introduction framework="Python" />

## 1. Install the SDK

<InstallSdkPython />

## 2. Add starter apps

Create a new file in your project where you'll add your Compose apps, e.g. `compose.py`, and paste the following code:

<StarterCodePython />

## 3. Start the Compose Client

In the main entry point of your project, e.g. `main.py`, add the following:

```python
from .compose import compose_client

# ... other code ...

# Run the client in a background thread. Use .connect() to run the client
# as a blocking process in the main thread.
compose_client.connect_async()
```

<ConnectClientDetailsPython framework="Django, Flask, etc." />

## 4. Run your app

Run your project's dev server. Compose will automatically connect in the background.

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see your apps come online in the [Compose web dashboard](https://app.composehq.com/home).
