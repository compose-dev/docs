# Installation | FastAPI

<Introduction framework="FastAPI" newProjectLink="/get-started/installation/new-project/python" language="Python" />

## 1. Install the SDK

<InstallSdkPython />

## 2. Add starter apps

Create a new file in your project where you'll add your Compose apps, e.g. `compose.py`, and paste the following code:

<StarterCodePython />

<ReplaceApiKey />


## 3. Start the Compose Client

In the main entry point of your project, e.g. `main.py`, add the following:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from .compose import compose_client

# Use the `lifespan` context manager to connect to the Compose servers once
# when the app starts up, and disconnect when the app shuts down.
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    compose_client.connect_async()
    yield
    compose_client.shutdown()

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

<ConnectClientDetailsPython framework="FastAPI" />

## 4. Run your app

Start your FastAPI server. Compose will automatically connect in the background.

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

You should see your apps come online in the [Compose web dashboard](https://app.composehq.com/home).
