# Guide | Troubleshooting Issues

This guide outlines common issues with Compose and how to troubleshoot them. You can also always ask questions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/82rk2N8ZE6) to talk to other users and members of the team.

## Slow Performance

Slow performance in Compose applications typically manifests as excessive latency.

### Understanding latency

Latency is caused by the following three factors:

- **Network Travel Time**: Time for messages to travel between browsers and SDK server (typically 50-150ms round trip for US-based users, higher internationally).
- **SDK Processing Time**: Time to process method calls like `page.add()` and `page.update()` (typically 5-25ms).
- **Application Processing Time**: Time for your business logic to execute (database queries, API calls, data transformations).

***Before diving into debugging, you should confirm that the latency is not due to time spent executing your own business logic.***

### Use Debug Mode

You can enable debug mode to identify which SDK operations are slow. When enabled, debug mode will log internal Compose operations and performance metrics to your console.

Performance metrics outside normal ranges will appear in <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>orange</span>. Pay special attention to any metrics that take longer than 100ms.

<Tabs groupId="sdkLanguage">
    <TabItem value="node" label="TypeScript / JavaScript">
    ```js
    const client = new Compose.Client({
        apiKey: "...",
        apps: [/* ... */],
        // highlight-next-line
        debug: true,
    })
    ``` 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    client = c.Client(
        api_key="...",
        apps=[...],
        # highlight-next-line
        debug=True,
    )
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you receive performance warnings, you can isolate the slow component by adding a `key` parameter to the `page.add()` and `page.modal()` calls, which will be reflected in the logs.

<Tabs groupId="sdkLanguage">
    <TabItem value="node" label="TypeScript / JavaScript">
    ```js
    page.add(() => ui.text("Hello, world!"), { key: "hello-text" });

    page.modal(() => ui.text("Hello, world!"), { key: "hello-modal" });
    ``` 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    page.add(lambda: ui.text("Hello, world!"), key="hello-text")

    page.modal(lambda: ui.text("Hello, world!"), key="hello-modal")
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

See the [debug mode guide](/guides/debug-mode) for more information on understanding the logs.

### Solutions

Once you've identified the slow `page.add()` or `page.modal()` call, you can try the following solutions:

#### Move business logic outside UI callbacks

When you call `page.update()`, Compose re-executes all callback functions passed to `page.add()` and `page.modal()`, then diffs the results against previously cached ones.

Thus, any business logic embedded inside the callback will also be re-executed. An easy solution is to move business logic outside the callback and only run it when needed.

<Tabs groupId="sdkLanguage">
    <TabItem value="node" label="TypeScript / JavaScript">
    ```js
    // ❌ INCORRECT
    page.add(() => 
        ui.table("users-table", db.fetchAllUsers()) // query runs on every update
    )

    // ✅ CORRECT
    let users = db.fetchAllUsers(); // query runs only once
    page.add(() => ui.table("users-table", users));

    users = db.fetchAllUsers(); // re-fetch only when needed
    page.update();
    ``` 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    # ❌ INCORRECT
    page.add(lambda: 
        ui.table("users-table", db.fetch_all_users())  # query runs on every update
    )

    # ✅ CORRECT
    users = db.fetch_all_users()  # query runs only once
    page.add(lambda: ui.table("users-table", users))

    users = db.fetch_all_users()  # re-fetch only when needed
    page.update()
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Optimize heavy components

Certain components are more expensive to render and update than others.

- **Large tables**: For tables with more than a couple hundred rows, consider using [pagination](/components/input/table#pagination).
- **Heavy charts**: For charts with many rows, consider pre-formatting the data instead of using the built in data transformation utilities.
- **Large PDFs/images**: Consider using compressed versions of PDFs and images.

#### Break up large apps

If your app has grown to many dozens of components, you can try breaking up your app into [multiple individual apps](/guides/multipage-apps) that link to each other.

## `page.update()` not working

If `page.update()` is not working as expected, read the [common pitfalls](/page-actions/update#common-pitfalls) section of the `page.update()` documentation.

## SDK issues

For non-performance related issues with the SDK, you can enable debug mode to log profiling information to your console.

<Tabs groupId="sdkLanguage">
    <TabItem value="node" label="TypeScript / JavaScript">
    ```js
    const client = new Compose.Client({
        apiKey: "...",
        apps: [/* ... */],
        // highlight-next-line
        debug: true,
    })
    ``` 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    client = c.Client(
        api_key="...",
        apps=[...],
        # highlight-next-line
        debug=True,
    )
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Debug mode can help you see if page method calls are being properly registered and executed by the SDK, and if the SDK is properly communicating with the browser. For a more detailed explanation of the logs, see the [debug mode](/guides/debug-mode) guide.
