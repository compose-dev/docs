# Guide | AI Assistant Integration

Compose abstracts the complexity of building internal software into a small set of composable, clearly defined methods that are far simpler for LLMs to write and maintain. 

Many users already use AI assistants like Cursor and Claude to build Compose Apps for them within their own IDEs. This guide will show you how to do the same.

## Integrate with Cursor

You can index Compose's documentation, then refer to it using the `@Compose` symbol. Cursor documentation: [link](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs#add-custom-docs).

#### Step 1: Open Cursor Settings

#### Step 2: Go to the Docs section

Then click "+ Add new doc".

#### Step 3: Add the Compose docs

#### Step 4: Confirm information

#### Step 5: Use with `@Compose` symbol

## Integrate with Github Copilot

Compose does not yet support a native Github Copilot integration. If you'd like to see this feature, please reach out by emailing us: atul@composehq.com.

## Other AI assistants

Due to how new Compose is, most AI assistants are not yet trained on it. We have thought about creating a v0/bolt.new style prompt window for generating Compose apps, but have not yet implemented it. If you'd like to see this feature, please reach out by emailing us: atul@composehq.com.
